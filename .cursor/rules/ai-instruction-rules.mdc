1. Maintain Code Consistency
Before adding new code, check which files are connected to the current file and update them accordingly.
Ensure consistency across CSS, PHP, and JS files.

2. Handle Labels & Translations Properly
When modifying labels, update the translation file accordingly.
Ensure that the correct string is translated.
Locate and update translations in the folder:
/subscription/translations.

3. Follow Existing Component Structure
Adhere to the established structure of components in the project.
Avoid unnecessary modifications to the projectâ€™s architecture.

4. Dependency Management
Do not add external libraries unless absolutely necessary.
Always check for existing code that can be reused.
If an external library is required, request confirmation before adding it.

5. Code Functionality Verification
Confirm that the added code works as expected before finalizing changes.
Run necessary tests to ensure stability.
